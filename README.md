# To-Do List App (Backend Only) â€” Web Programming Assignment
This is a simple backend-only To-Do List application built using Node.js and Express.js as part of a Web Programming practical assignment. It provides three API endpoints to add, view, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in-memory using a JavaScript array (no database). The available API routes are: `POST /addTask` to add a task (expects a JSON body with `taskName`), `GET /tasks` to retrieve all tasks, and `DELETE /task/:id` to remove a task by its ID. The application runs on `http://localhost:3000`. API functionality is tested using Postman with screenshots provided for all three operations (POST, GET, DELETE). This project is lightweight and perfect for learning how to build RESTful APIs with Express.
